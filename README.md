# Hamiltonian Simulation Formulation

This document is taken from the initial discussion notes and is really unpolished. Also, obviously work-in-progress.

We will implement Hamiltonian simulation in Coq.

We will implement the syntax. We then either prove some basic facts on its semantics, or implement compilation to quantum circuit. Or possibly both if time permits.

## What is Hamiltonian simulation?

Hamiltonian simulation methods are a widely studeid area and have been used to efficiently simulate physical quantum systems 
and to construct quantum algorithms that rely on Hamiltonian dynamics. A Hamiltonian H(t) of a system is an operator that represents the total energy of a given quantum system. We also requre that 
H(t) is Hermitian to ensure the energies are real valued numbers. The eigenvalue for a specific eigenstate of H(t) represent the energy of the state represented by the eigenstate. The ground state of a 
Hamiltonian corresponds to the eigenstate with the smallest eigenvalue. This represents the state with the lowest energy level. Finding the ground state of a Hamiltonian is a particularly useful problem 
used in many quantum applications (i.e. quantum verification, quantum algorithms, etc.) and is generally difficult for even quantum computer. "Simulating" a Hamiltonian can refer to finding the ground state
of a Hamiltonian, but can also refer to describing a quantum system at a given time t. In quantum mechanics, a Hamiltonian can be used describe the time evolution of the wave function through the Schrodinger equation. Namely, we can describe a wave function, |&phi;(t)>, through the Schrodinger equation: 	i&#8463; = d/dt|&phi;(t)> = H(t)|&phi(t)>. 
where &#8463; is Planck's constant. Given the intial wave function at time t=0, we can solve this differential equation to find the wave function at any later time t. 

Hamiltonians can be time independent, or time dependent. In this work, we will only consider time-independent Hamiltonians. For time independent hamiltonians, the solution of the Schrodinger equation is |&phi;(t)> = U(t)|&phi;(0)> where the unitary U(t) = e^{-iht/&#8463;}. 
We can describe a Hamiltoninan H to be efficiently simulatable if for ant t > 0, &epsilon; > 0, there exists a unitary U' such that ||U' - H(t) || < &epsilon;. In our work, we will formall prove 
properites of Hamiltonians and their efficient simulation. 

## Relevant works

TODO describe [this library](https://rand.cs.uchicago.edu/vqc/) and maybe [SQIR/VOQC](https://github.com/inQWIRE/SQIR).

TODO What exactly has been done before, and how are we adding onto existing work?

I think Dr. Wu said something about 2x2 matrices were currently brute forced? What did he mean by that? Does that matter to us?

## Syntax

The formal grammar is provided below. We will implement it using a similar strategy as how the `Imp` language from the Software Foundation textbook is defined and parsed.

### Formal grammar

* `A`: identifier
* `z`: complex number
* `r`: real number
* `t`: positive real number.

<pre><code>Type := <b>qubit</b> | <b>fock</b>
Operator := Id | X | Y | Z | a | c
Declaration := (T A)*
Scalar := S_1 + S_2 | S_1 * S_2 | S_1 - S_2 | S_1 / S_2 | exp(S) | cos(S) | sin(S) | z | r
TIH := M_1 + M_2 | M_1 * M_2 | S * M | A.O
TIH_Sequence := (A : t, M)*
Program := <b>Site</b> Declaration; <b>Hamiltonian</b> TIH_Sequence
</code></pre>

### Example

The following is a valid Hamiltonian simulation program:

```
Site
    fock "F1"
    qubit "Q1"
    qubit "Q2"
    qubit "Q3" ;
Hamiltonian
    ( "H1" : R1 , "Q1" > X * "Q2" > Z + "Q3" > Y )
    ( "H2" : R1 , "Q2" > Y )
    ( "H3" : R1 , "F1" > c )
)
```

In the first *Site* section, four variables are declared. We have `F1` of type fock, as well as `Q1`, `Q2`, and `Q3` of type qubit.
We then describe the desired evolution in the *Hamiltonian* section.
Namely, we have three Hamiltonians, `H1`, `H2`, and `H3`, applied in that order for one unit of time each.

The corresponding quantities are... TODO learn how to work with MathML?
```
H1 = X ot Z ot I + I ot I ot Y...
```

## Semantics

Goal: Be able to prove when different Hamiltonians have the same semantics.
For example, if `H_1` and `H_2` commute, then `(H_1: t_1) (H_2, t_2)` and `(H_2: t_2) (H_1, t_1)` have the same semantics.

Challenge: matrix exponentials. Not even sure how to represent it.
We were suggested to define it symbolically and state valid rewrite rules that respect Schr√∂dinger's equation.
Need to discuss the details though.

## Compilation

First write down the compiler using *trotterization* (TODO explain). We can then analyze its properties.
For example, how much error it generates.

Here we can just assume the gate set to be whatever convenient for us.
We can also assume the Hamiltonian is *local*.
